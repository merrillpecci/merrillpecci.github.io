                    <p><b>Equity.</b> Put simply, equity is the distribution of resources and opportunities among people. It is the root of justice, as it emphasizes the importance of addressing disparities and ensuring that everyone has access to the same opportunities and outcomes regardless of their background or circumstances. In our world, much emphasis is placed on fighting for social and economic equality, centering on the objectives of fairness, non-discrimination, and impartiality. While I share the same end goals, I also advocate for the understanding that equity is a crucial component in establishing a society built on care and elevating marginalized people in a way that does not erase the very real struggles they endure. Equity goes a necessary step further than equality because it acknowledges the truths of systemic obstacles and marginalization. We must acknowledge these truths in order to properly redistribute resources and eradicate existing harm. I believe equity should be a constant goal both in and outside of the workplace. Authentic allyship means paying attention to how the world is shaped and which systems serve whom, regardless of scale. It means noting when and where we fail to achieve accessibility, anti-racism, and queer allyship, and what it takes to correct it. Each and every person deserves more than just their basic needs met and their rights protected. Equity ensures that everyone is wholly accounted for in this mission without sacrificing identity. </p>

                    <p><b>Community Engagement.</b> Since college, my perspective on ambition has evolved, leading me to consistently answer the question "what do you want to be when you grow up?" with one response: "an active community member." I believe that our connection to community holds greater significance in understanding value than mere productivity. Active participation in any community fosters a culture of care. Community engagement manifests in various forms, whether through assuming official roles in organizations, attending intentional spaces, or contributing to mutual aid efforts. While I aspire to pursue community-driven roles like librarianship, I am equally committed to actively engaging with and supporting communities in any capacity. In professional settings, I enjoy organizing events and fostering collaborative spaces. In personal endeavors, I continuously strive to identify opportunities for improvement and contribute to communities on both small and large scales.</p>

                    <p><b>Social Justice.</b> Social justice serves as an umbrella term encompassing concepts like equity, yet it merits its distinct category as my deepest principle. I believe in the right to pursue social justice through tangible actions, such as protest and disruption. Achieving social justice often demands discomfort and a continuous challenge to confront privilege, especially when it leads to disproportionate advantages. I advocate for active resource redistribution to address community needs, combat systemic marginalization, and support collective action. I approach any institution or idea with a critical lens, recognizing that our systems still perpetuate racism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, and ableism. It is imperative to dismantle these harmful systems and uplift marginalized communities, including queer individuals, BIPOC, indigenous peoples, undocumented individuals, and those with disabilities, as we strive to cultivate an equitable world.</p>

                    <p><b>Public Services.</b> I believe that accessible public services are essential for achieving equity, social justice, and fostering community engagement. Public services encompass various sectors, including education, healthcare, public transportation, social services, infrastructure, parks & recreation, environmental services, among others, which should be regarded as necessities rather than luxuries. Prioritizing resource availability is crucial for ensuring accessibility, which forms the foundation of social and economic equity and disability justice. I advocate for the expansion of affordable public transit as a key environmental initiative and a means of connecting underserved communities to essential services. Enhancing public transit not only reduces car dependency but also influences urban development positively while promoting health and accessibility. Advocating for all public services, with a particular focus on transit and library access, is essential for constructing an equitable society.</p>

                    <p><b>The Third Place.</b> The term "the third place," coined by Ray Oldenburg in <i>The Great Good Place</i>, refers to spaces distinct from the first place (home) and the second place (work), where people gather, socialize, and interact outside their usual environments. Third places are characterized by accessibility, comfort, and inclusivity, serving as community hubs where individuals from diverse backgrounds come together to engage in casual conversation, exchange ideas, and build relationships. Beyond being a physical space, the third place embodies a philosophy. Libraries epitomize this concept, offering spaces with minimal barriers to entry. In modern America (United States), we face a shortage of such places, with libraries often serving as the primary third place despite limited funding. For me, this "value" symbolizes equity and highlights how our social infrastructure can be shaped by accessible physical spaces that promote the freedom to fully exist. Consequently, I am a staunch advocate for creating and sustaining third places.</p>

                    <p><b>Continuous Growth.</b> My final value is really just my own personal commitment to lifelong learning. Growth, for me, is not just about climbing a career ladder; it entails never-ending self education. Growth looks like passing the mic, listening, engaging with new topics, exploring fresh ideas, keeping up with current events, confronting mine and others' hardship, and refusing to limit my capacity to adapt and change. While I excidetly acknowledge that I have a lifetime of growing to do, I can confidently say that my proudest improvements stem from meaninful relationships. I never regret meeting a new face and learning from their perspective. Peer education and connection have been invaluable in shaping all of these goals, and laid the groundwork for an exciting career, whatever form it may take.</p>
