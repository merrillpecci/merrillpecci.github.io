                <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Merrill, I use she/they pronouns. I am a 25-year-old, Boston-based working professional breaking into the library sciences field. I obtained my bachelor's degree at Simmons University. Following my undergraduate studies centered on intersecting factors of race, class, sexuality, and gender in political theory and economics, I promised to commit to some form of work addressing accessibility and resource allocation. This is undoubtably a driving tenant in the field of library sciences, and the underlying reason for me returning to Simmons to obtain my MLIS. In addition to my education, my queer identity and professional experience aided in the realization that I can flourish in an institution whose priority is to meet public need. I wholeheartedly envision myself as a public librarian. A library is a tangible space representing my every belief. Libraries are at their core intended to provide free public services for all, and good librarians seek to expand what these services entail. They level fields through the dissemination of knowledge, aid, technological and language accessibility, and are only growing in scope as we introduce social work concepts like housing, professional development, LGBTQ resources for youth, cultural programs, online reading, digital media, college prep, “libraries of things,” and personal connection. My strongest principle is that every human deserves active access to basic needs and beyond, and that community work is the means by which we can offer the truest support our country’s institutions fail to provide. </p>

                <p>My experience as an immigration paralegal is strongly connected to this ambition. In my work, I have aided workers with the arduous process of obtaining non-immigrant and immigrant visas. While I happily assist in this process, it is not lost on me how many people, especially those with limited resources, the system fails. Our libraries have a great opportunity to facilitate programs for immigrants in Boston who are adjusting to a new place and navigating prejudice. I envision bringing in legal experts or hosting events which provide clarity on intimidating processes ranging from visa options and applications, passport processes, interview advice, and other confounding government processes. To sum it up, I am on an exciting career journey, ready to bring my lived experiences and field expertise to the library.</p>

                <p>This website will eventually serve as a place to discuss these intersections of my work, my values, and other topics pertinent to librarianship and community building.</p>
