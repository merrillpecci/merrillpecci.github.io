                    <h3>Traveling</h3>
                    <p>I spent my childhood in Alaska (pictured here) and moved to Texas when I was a teenager. As a result of adapting in such starkly different places, I grew eager to explore. I now love visiting new cities and landscapes, but with a loose itinerary. My favorite parts of a vacation are the in-between moments- time spent in a cafe, a good meal, a peaceful moment outside, or a conversation with a stranger. My favorite place to be is in the mountains, but I find equal enjoyment in cities, as I love what they have to offer!</p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>I am extremely passionate about music. While I myself am an amateur instrument player, I listen to music every single day. I enjoy nearly all genres, and love learning about the history, art, and life of the artist I am listening to. The above photos were taken by me at a Sleater Kinney concert (my favorite band), and featured on their social media. This was a proud moment of accidental concert photography, and sparked a new interest! </p>

                    <h3>Animal Caretaking</h3>
                    <p>In addition to my day job, I offer pet sitting and dog walking services for people in my community. This comes from my deep love of animals, having grown up with them. Pictured in order: Wilson, Henry, Cleo (mine), and Luna.</p>

                    <h3>Sports</h3>
                    <p>I have been playing soccer since age four, and maintain my love for the beautiful game by watching the US Women's National Team play. For a change of pace, I also keep up with Formula One. I am fascinated with the engineering and politics driving this competition, and watch every race I can!</p>

                    <h3>Nerdy Stuff!</h3>
                    <p>Possibly my most exciting hobby is the most recent. I have always been an avid gamer, but only recently have I been a proud one. As I grow older, I see the value in unapologetically learning new things, and leaning fully into whatever you enjoy- even if it seems inconsequential. I recently built my own gaming PC, and signed up to partake in table-top role playing games. TTRPGs are a new activity in my life, both virtually and in-person. Through them, I have found new communities and learned more about story-building and event organization. I hope to contribute to similar activities in a library setting.</p>
